/*
    You can only achieve some fast performance with stored procedure just because it is cached in sql server in binary form and only function call with para goes to sql every time

    Real performance you can achieve with efficient query 

    1. Sql partitioning of searching huge data **
    2. Instead of update use case
    3. Use temperory table for joins and delete them after use
    4. Avoid joins instead use sub query if possible **
    5. Avoid cursor,triggers
    6. Select exact amount of data needed
    7. Use stored procedures **
    8. Avoid distinct instead use group by self join **
    9. Use EXISTS instead of where IN
    10. Avoid subquery use CTE
